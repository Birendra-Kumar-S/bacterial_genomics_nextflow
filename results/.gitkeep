# This .gitkeep file ensures Git tracks this otherwise empty directory
# Git does not track empty directories by default
# 
# This allows the results directory structure to be preserved when cloning or
# pulling the repository while excluding the actual results from version control
# Output files from workflow execution should be placed in this directory
